title: Cell segmentation
order: 2

---


Our two step approach includes cellpose and baysor.

- [Cellpose](cellpose/index.qmd) creates a segmentation based on the image data. 
- [Baysor](baysor/index.qmd) then used the transcript neighboorhood to refine the segmentation.

Lastly, we put everything together in an [Anndata object](anndata/index.qmd) that can be used for downstream analysis.
