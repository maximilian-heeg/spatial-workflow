### Part 1: [Quanitify auxiliary stainings](auxiliary/index.qmd)

We will identify transcripts on the FISH images (sequential imaing rounds of the MERSCOPE run) and combine that with the MerFISH detected transcripts.

### Part 2: [Cell segmentation](cell_segmentation/index.qmd)

Our two step approach includes cellpose and baysor.

- [Cellpose](cell_segmentation/cellpose/index.qmd) creates a segmentation based on the image data. 
- [Baysor](cell_segmentation/baysor/index.qmd) then used the transcript neighboorhood to refine the segmentation.

Lastly, we put everything together in an [Anndata object](cell_segmentation/anndata/index.qmd) that can be used for downstream analysis.

### Part 3: [Analysis](analysis//index.qmd)

This sections contains the scripts for QC, cell annotation and the export to ZARR and OME-TIFF that are used in the [browser](https://merscope.heeg.io)
